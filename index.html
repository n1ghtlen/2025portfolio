        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p class="about-me"><b>My name is Daylen Polidori</b> and I'm currently a
            student at the University of Central Florida studying Digital
            Media, specifically Web and Interactive Media.</p>
                <p>In my free time, my interests lie pretty much anywhere in the digital space. I really enjoy
                photography, graphic design, video creation, and games. I also love to read and
                dabble in crafts like crochet and cross-stitch.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm a <b>web designer</b> and <b>UX/UI designer</b> at heart and love the psychology of the user, but I also have a decent grasp on HTML/CSS/Javascript.
                <br>
                <br>
                I’m looking forward to exploring potential opportunities!

                <h3>Local Florist Landing Page</h3>
                <img src="prairieroselanding.jpg" class="project-image">
                <p class="project-info">
                    This is the landing page for <i>Prairie Rose</i>, my brief version of a webpage design for a florist. I developed the logo concept using <b>Illustrator</b> and created the layout in <b>Figma.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was inspired to create this concept after seeing the websites of some of my local florists, as many have jarring color schemes, outdated designs, and clunky navigation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I ensured the address is clear and easy to read, with a <u>Contact</u> navigation tab as well as a phone icon on the landing page both leading to the business's phone number.
                    Hovering on the <u>Occasion</u> tab would reveal a hamburger dropdown of multiple occasion options, rather than a common practice I've observed of having individual navigation
                    tabs for each occasion. I also opted for a <u>Gallery</u> tab, allowing the business to show off professional photos of their bouquets to attract new customers and give them ideas for their own
                    arrangements before purchasing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also believe that personal connection with customers is important, especially for a local business, so the <u>About Us</u> tab would contain a professional image of and some
                    background about the florist.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I feel that one legible main font is simple and effective for the website's goal of leading the user to purchase flowers and arrangements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Keeping in mind current design trends, I chose <u>MegaFresh</u> for my logo concept, and <u>Switzer</u> Regular, Semibold and Extrabold for paragraph text and headers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also opted for light pinks with simple black and white UI to compliment and soften the dark pink present in the design without overwhelming it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h3>"Oneiria" App Concept MidFi</h3>
                <video src="oneiria.mp4" class="project-image" controls muted></video>
                <p class="project-info">
                    This is one of the first mid-fidelty prototypes I created using <b>Figma</b> of a proposed app I came up with called Oneiria,
                    a social platform where users can document and discuss or analyze their dreams in a social media format with other users.
                    The name "Oneiria" is inspired by the Greek word "oneiros" which is the personification of dreams in Greek mythology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I didn’t necessarily find any particular platforms as direct inspiration for this, but I did look at other forum platforms like <i>Reddit</i> and <i>Quora</i>
                    to get an idea of how the app should generally be structured.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After consulting potential users, tag/keyword search functionality was implemented into the design. Users can explore dreams of all kinds,
                    whether they are about nightmares, uncanny landscapes, or fantasy adventures. This is sort of a comparable concept to subreddits
                    on Reddit. I also wanted to give users topics that they could explore when they’re not sure what to look at, similar to other forum websites.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is essentially a social media app that encourages user interaction through dream experiences and personal expression. I wanted to keep it simple enough while also adding the color and
                    whimsical design that other platforms often don’t have.

                <h3>Florida OSFA Redesign</h3>
                <img src="beforeredesign.jpg" class="project-image">
                <img src="afterredesign.jpg" class="project-image">
                <p class="project-info">After reflecting on my own experiences using the Florida OSFA website, I decided to use <b>HTML/CSS</b> with my knowledge of web design to revamp its 
                    arguably outdated landing page (before).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The landing page is the main hub and the first thing a user sees a majority of the time. I know how important it is that it's easy to understand and gets users where they want to go
                    with the least amount of time and clicks as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Indigo and gold is the main color scheme for the OSFA's other pages, unlike their landing page shown here, so I made sure to incorporate those colors into the design.
                    I also noticed the navigation bar off to the left in the original design is a bit convoluted with wordy tabs and inconsistent formatting. Overall the design could be more intuitive and user-focused,
                    especially considering its function.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That leads me to the main thing I kept in mind about the nature of the OSFA website is its audience: students and their parents looking for financial aid resources, no matter what they are. I figured it would be beneficial
                    to include the mission statement on the landing page versus hiding it behind a clickable button to show the purpose of the agency. This provides confirmation to the user that they're in the right place
                    while also defining the agency's goals and values.
                    I also converted the sidebar nav buttons into a top navigation bar with clear and simple wording to get users to their goals quicker.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The final result is cleaner and a bit more modern, while also maintaining cohesion with the external pages it links to.

                <video src="shelfmate.mov" class="project-image" controls muted></video>
                <p class="project-info">This is a hifi app concept created in <b>Figma</b> for ShelfMate, my project group's app in development
                    with the goal of allowing users to track their grocery purchases, upload and view their groceries in their virtual pantry, and make decisions based on their
                    dietary preferences or restrictions. The app allows the user to:
                    <br>
                    <br>- Use the barcode scanning function and alternatively a receipt scanning function (using OCR technology) to upload items to their virtual pantry
                    <br>
                    <br>- View information of a product in order for the user to make informed decisions
                    <br>
                    <br>- See recipes using the items in the user's pantry
                    <br>
                    <br>- View a personal pantry curated by the user with quantity and nutritional information, which can be viewed through three different location containers
                    depending on type: the fridge, the freezer, and the cupboard
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We ensured navigation was intuitive and highlighted the main features of the app: the home containing the user's personal pantry, scanning, recipes, and personal preferences.

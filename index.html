                    arguably outdated landing page (pictured on bottom), as it isn't very cohesive with the other pages linked on
                    the site. I redesigned it (pictured on top) to not only accomplish cohesion but also to implement navigation that is easier to
                    understand.

                    <br>
                    I love incorporating these tones as they allow me to explore color in a way that keeps the design minimalistic, sleek, and easy on the eyes.

                    <br>
                    Accessibility is a priority in my design choices, and I find that subtle palettes allow me to explore color while keeping accessibility in mind.

                    <br>
                    Taking a design from visual conception to code is one of the most exciting parts of web development for me and is a <u>major reason I’m drawn to this field!</u></p>
